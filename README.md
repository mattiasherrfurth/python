# python
a collection of scripts i have written in various professional and educational projects, where proprietary info has been scrubbed from the files.

the purpose of this repository is to be a porfolio of my work, where this serves several deliverables:
  - a way to collect my code for reuse in future projects
  - an open source of code for others to use as needed
  - proven expertise of scripting for future employment and teaching purposes
